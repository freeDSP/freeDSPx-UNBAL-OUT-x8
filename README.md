# freeDSPx-UNBAL-OUT-x8
This is a freeDSP expansion board for 8x unbalanced outputs.

Currently this board only works with the SMD A Variant of the freeDSP as there needs to be a 5V supply and MCLK for the ADCs.

## V1.0
- first working version

## V1.1
- added a big via underneath the DAC for handsolering
