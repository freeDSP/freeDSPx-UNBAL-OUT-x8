# freeDSPx-UNBAL-OUT-x8

BOARD STATUS: READY TO BE BUILT ? / WORK IN PROGRESS ?

MAIN COORDINATOR: [Thor368](https://github.com/Thor368)

This is a freeDSP expansion board for 8x unbalanced outputs.

Currently this board only works with the SMD Variant of the freeDSP as there needs to be a 5V supply and MCLK for the ADCs.

Status: untested
